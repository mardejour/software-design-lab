# MARYAM's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Git and the command line, including an hour with the DHRI command line tutorial. I found Git to be tough going, but feel like I made solid progress learning how to use pipes on the command line, though I'm still a little confused on the details of how they work. I also started learning how to run scripts in Python, which was very time consuming.

Hour 1: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 2: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 3: Phone call with classmate to fiture out pipes
Hour 4: Tried running a "hello world" Python script
Hour 5: ''
Hour 6: ''
Hour 7: Should have given up, but got the script eworking, though I'm still not sure what went wrong.

## Week Six (03/07)
After introducing myself to programming paradigms, I wanted to learn to create and use functions in Python. Out of all three paradigms, I found functional concepts to be the easiest to grasp compared to others, because instead of writing a new code it allows us to reuse a piece of code by changing different values and reuse it multiple times for different purposes.

Hour 1: I learned to define a function and assign a procedure for it to call a function using parameters and arguments. 
In addition, I practiced if, elif, and else statements and tried to import a function into python. 
In the course of doing this I discovered several new operators, such as:
*= 
**
f ....
tbc
I also learned more about built in functions in Python. 
Hour 2: I reviewed DHRI's HTML and CSS tutorials to refresh my memory 
Hour 3: Classes and Instances - learned to create methods wwithin a class (__init___)


Week Seven (03/21)
this week i learned more expressions and what they mean:

+= to sum and reassign (or incriment?) 
operators: 
if statement (true/false), don't forget curly brackets around the line of code to run;
else & else if clauses (I wasn't sure if it will only run if the previous statement was false);
logical operators: && - logical 'and' operator, will return true if placed between two ooleans that are both true; for example, if it's the weekend and it's sunny out, then we are going to have a picnic . if one them is false, there won't be no picnic.
if (True && False) == False 
logical "or" operator || - will retunr true if placed between two booleans and either is true.
